## Migration Notes

### Server
- The server components have been migrated with minimal changes to adapt to the main project structure.
- The AI agents now extend the BaseAgent class from the main project.
- Memory management has been simplified to work with the main project's storage system.

### Client
- The client components have been created to match the design of the main project.
- Authentication and Web3 contexts need to be properly integrated with the backend.
- The UI components use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Mock data is used for demonstration purposes and needs to be replaced with actual API calls.

## Next Steps
1. Address linter errors in the client components
2. Implement the remaining UI components
3. Connect the frontend to the backend APIs
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete application
