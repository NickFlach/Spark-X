## Migration Notes

### Linter Errors

The main linter errors were related to:

1. Missing module declarations for React, lucide-react, and other libraries
2. JSX configuration issues
3. Implicit any types in event handlers
4. Inconsistent type definitions

These issues have been addressed by:

1. Creating proper TypeScript configuration files
2. Adding type definitions for React and other libraries
3. Creating shared schema types
4. Providing documentation on how to fix remaining errors

### Next Steps

1. Run the fix-linter.bat script to install dependencies and set up the project structure
2. Connect the client components to the backend APIs
3. Implement the remaining server functionality
4. Set up testing and CI/CD
